# Welcome to the Never-Go-Solo-Carcenter 

This project started out as an school project but now has turned into a passion project. The goal is create a a full fledged web application geared towards a car-center. This is more a learning experience for the contributors of this project. During the development of this application we will try to adhere to most of the coding standards present in every technology we are using at the time. 

We will try to incorporate best practices like the solid principles etc.

### Phase 1:

This current version is very simple but in the coming weeks it will but updated to add JavaScript ,**jQuery**, and also use an PHP framework ,**Codeigniter**, instead of just plain PHP. Also the styling will be updated to use **Bootstrap 4**.

### Phase 2:

In phase 2 this web application will be re-written with **ASP.NET core MVC**. We will still use MySQL as the database but with an ORM **EntityFramework**. The front end framework will still be **jQuery** and **Bootstrap 4**.

### Phase 3:

In phase 3 we will transition this application to a **Single Page Application **(SPA). For this we will use **Angular(5+)**. This time the front-end framework will be **PrimeNG**. The database will still be MySQL , but the ORM will now be **Dapper.NET**. 

### Phase 4:

In this phase the application will be made into a mobile application. We will decide at a later date if we will  use a Hybrid framework like **Ionic(2+)** or frameworks like **Nativescript**, **ReactNative** , **Flutter** or **Xamarin**. We also have the choice to go full native but this seem a bit too time consuming.
